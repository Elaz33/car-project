<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
<h4>Part a:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create a svelte store to represent a list of cars</li>
  <li>Make it a simple "writeable" store</li>
  <li>Each car in the list should have the following properties: make, model, year, mileage, condition</li>
  <li>Note: for reference, check out the store we made live the other day. The endpoint route is here: <a href="/exercises/4/basic-store-example">/exercises/4/basic-store-example</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Part b:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create a svelte file to display the current list of cars at <a href="/exercises/4/my-answer">/exercises/4/my-answer</a></li>
  <li>Create a table to display the list of cars.  Each car should be depicted as a row in the table, and the table should have column headers.</li>
  <li>Another developer is going to build a svelte file to modify the contents of the store, so for now just worry about displaying the list of cars and not modifying anything.</li>
</ul>
